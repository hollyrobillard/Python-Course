## Problem
I am working on a program to help me manage and organize the requirements for a new product, including the requirements for the MVP and future enhancements. The main problem I am trying to solve for is how to efficiently record, prioritize, and keep track of these requirements all in one place. The input data for the program will include requirement descriptions, numeric priority level, story points, date added, and status (To Do, In Progress, Done). The program will help me easily add requirements, update existing ones, and rework priorities. I can also store requirements by release (MVP, Release 1, and Release 2) and move requirements between each release and the backlog. The end result will be a clear and organized list of requirements that can be managed effectively, ensuring nothing gets lost or overlooked during the product development process.

## Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Add a new requirement to the backlog**
1.	Select option to add a new requirement from the user menu
2.	Input the requirement description
3.	Input the priority level
4.	Input the story points
5.	Inputs saved in the backlog alongside the automatically created requirement ID, date added and To Do status
6.	Return to the user menu

**Scenario 2: Move a requirement from the backlog to the MVP release**
1.	Select option to view the requirements in the backlog from the user menu
2.	Select option to move a requirement from the secondary user menu
3.	Input the requirement ID associated with the requirement to be moved
4.	Input which release to add the requirement to (MVP release)
5.	Requirement moved to MVP release
6.	Return to the user menu
